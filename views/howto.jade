		h1 Getting started
		p Setting up your project is very simple!
		h2 What you need:
		ul
			li A Javascript project repository hosted at <a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a>
			li <a href='http://usejsdoc.org'>JSDoc</a> formated source code comments. Well, this may be some work... but it pays off shortly!

		p If you have this in place, just follow these simple steps.
		h2 Steps
		ol
			li 
				h4 Log in
				p <a href='/auth/github'>Log in</a> with your GitHub account and grant doclets access to
					| your profile. Doclets also needs access to your repositories webhooks in order to work.

			li
				h4 Enable your Repo
				p Enable your respective repository in your account's <a href='/account'>repository</a> section.
					| Doclets will create a webhook for every enabled repository to get informed about
					| changes to your repository and tag creation.
			
			li
				h4 Create .doclets.yml file
				p Similar to other CI services, doclets needs a configuration file to know what to do with
					| your repository. This file tells doclets which source files to consider and which 
					| additional <em>markdown</em> files to include to your documentation.
				p Create a <code>.doclets.yml</code> file in the root directory of your master branch.

			li
				h4 Push!
				p Add, commit and push your repository changes to GitHub. Your documentation will be published
					| to doclets.io automatically.
